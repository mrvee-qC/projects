# projects

This is the mini-projects repo for the group. Mini-projects are useful way to learn, and also provide a means to engage with each other in the Zoom sessions. At present there is no particular structure, so feel free to add the code for your mini-project inside a directory. Collaboration on mini-projects is encouraged, but not required.

## Got a project suggestion?

Initially it's a good idea to raise it on the [Slack channel](https://quantumlondon-q5z3100.slack.com), since there will be greater exposure to the rest of the group. Eventually it would be nice to have ideas on the repository discussion board.

## Looking for project inspiration?

A straightforward way to search for inspiration is to look at [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). Since these are commissioned in partnership with businesses or non-profits, they directly represent real problems of interest. For those interested in QML, it should be straightforward to "quantise" the problems. Similarly, datasets are available via the [Kaggle open datasets page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

For those interested in non-QML methods, the [Qiskit documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/) features tutorial applications that could be a valuable starting point. For example, choose a tutorial example and consider how it might be generalised or adapted to a different domain or problem. Similarly, Kaggle competitions can be re-formulated for solutions that don't involve machine learning.

## Know a domain expert?

As a community, we're looking for interesting but manageable mini-projects for quantum computing amateurs, but do not necessarily have domain expertise in interesting areas (such as quantum chemistry). If you know someone who can propose good mini-projects (and ideally, resources to help get started), their contribution here would be highly valued.
